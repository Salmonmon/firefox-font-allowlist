# firefox-font-allowlist

a list of icon fonts which should not be overiden by firefox assembled from my personal use

to use go to about:config in firefox (and forks therof), find
> browser.display.use_document_fonts.icon_font_allowlist

and copy the contents of fontlist from this repository to replace it's value

this will only have an effect if font overide is on

if you come across a website and font which is not in this list, make an issue and I'll add it
